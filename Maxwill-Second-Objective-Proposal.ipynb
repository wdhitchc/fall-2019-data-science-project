    "The competition poses a rather one dimensional question about predicting performance of a user. It could be interesting instead to use the user data to create a profile of types of players and see if that more wholesome approach can lead to better predictions. Specifically, looking at macro and micro time data information could provide meta insights that could be indirect predictors of performance and gauge engagement with the application.\n",
